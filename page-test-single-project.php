                    <h2>The View Battersea Park</h2>
                    <p>
                        Located to the south of Battersea Park, this 15 storey mixed-use scheme offers stunning views across the Park towards the City of London.
                        A triple-height glazed façade connects the three storey office facility to the newly formed public realm that opens up the corner site. Above, 39
                        residential units above benefit from beautifully planted roof terraces, whilst making use of the underground basement parking.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The slipped massing of the planform allows the scheme to address its corner site location, whilst respecting the proximity of the neighbouring school
                        site to the rear. The height of the building responds also to the changing topography of the local context, stepping down in height as it addresses
                        the street front to the north.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fabric and glass vertical fins are framed by an external double storey pre-cast concrete structure. The glass fins actively perform to reduce solar gain
                        to the façade. Bronze anodized aluminium panelling complement the fins offering contrast and definition to this well-placed scheme. At roof level, the
                        massing reduces to create communal and private terraces, offering stunning views towards the river and the City of London.
